time now. If you check out my <a href=/2014/01/09/reading-list/>2013 reading list</a> you
may have noticed a Haskell book in there. Haskell was my introduction to thinking
without state, but rather with immutable data structures and the syntax was so
entirely different from what I was used to with JavaScript that I could not
merely port my knowledge for how to solve a problem over in most situations.</p><p>Haskell didn’t have much practical benefit to me, either. After getting through
the book there was nothing pushing me onward.</p><p>I’ve recently begun my second attempt into the functional world, this time with
ClojureScript. I intend on writing about this journey over the next few months,
so let’s get started.</p><h2 id=why-a-functional-language>Why a functional language?</h2><p>It took only a tiny introduction to the functional world to realize how
different solving problems could be. My slight foray into Haskell already
changed how I think about building applications and organizing code. I figure I
could get more bang for the educational buck by learning a fundamentally
different way of solving problems with a functional language compared to picking
up another OOP language.</p><h2 id=why-clojurescript>Why ClojureScript?</h2><p>There are two closely related, yet distinct points to this that I think are
worth mentioning.</p><ol><li>Why Clojure/ClojureScript over F#, Scheme, Haskell, OCaml, Erlang,
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Functional_languages>et cetera</a>?</li><li>Why do I think I’ll stick through to competency with the language?</li></ol><h3 id=why-clojure>Why Clojure?</h3><p>There are some circumstantial reasons that have led to Clojure being on my
radar.</p><p>I’ve used many of the leading JavaScript frameworks in production, most recently
React. React is the first tool I’ve used that didn’t leave a bad taste in my
mouth when I was finished. In fact, I’ve rather enjoyed every moment of it and
couldn’t imagine building a browser-based application without it.</p><p>One of the books that I started reading this year was the <a href=http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html>Structure and
Interpretation of Computer
Programs</a>. I have only
read the first three sections of the first chapter, but that gave me enough lisp
knowledge to understand the basic semantics of languages that follow the lisp
structure.</p><p>During this time, <a href=http://swannodette.github.io/>David Nolen</a> started appearing
again and again in my feed and was talking about all this ClojureScript,
immutable data, core.async stuff. (Aside: it may be worth adding that I
fundamentally believe that the default “complex JavaScript codebase decoupling
through arbitrary events” pattern to be a poor choice, and that my time in the
Angular world was on a team that found the best way to pass data around to just
arbitrarily mutate the nearest object.)</p><p>Since my experience and relevancy is rooted entirely in building user interfaces
in the browser world, tools and approaches that I can relate to my problem set
win over other concepts, such as the “proof”-iness that Haskell provides.</p><h3 id=why-will-i-stick-with-it>Why will I stick with it?</h3><p>This is the sticking point. I am a very driven, self-motivated individual, but
am terrible at focusing on any one thing for long enough to complete it. I am
regularly spinning up new experiments and rewriting side projects long before
getting them out the door.</p><p>Because ClojureScript can help solve problems I have building user interfaces is
a huge plus to sticking this through. Honestly, that’s probably the primary
reason that I will continue with it for any length of time.</p><p>Everything else will be myself experimenting on myself. Setting myself a
commitment to write about my journey I hope is enough perceived social pressure
to keep going.</p><h2 id=what-to-expect-next>What to expect next?</h2><p>My current expectation is that the next two posts in the <a href=/tags/clojurescript/>Learning ClojureScript
for JavaScripters</a> series will be a “just enough” syntactic
overview, and then how to solve some common JavaScript problems in ClojureScript.</p></div></article><footer class=py:24><div class="f:fade-30 f:14 mb:8"></div></footer></div></div></body></html>
