I will contribute to open source more.
I will learn more.
I will smile more.
I will have fun with my wife and kids more.
I will give back more.</p><p>I‚Äôve been thinking about what I <em>want</em> to be doing for a while now. What do I
want to accomplish in the next few years? How do I want to impact the world and
those around me? I think I‚Äôve come to this basic understanding of myself.</p><ul><li>I prefer building tools that <em>enable others</em> to create.</li><li>I love learning and appreciate being in over my head.</li><li>I want to live in the future.</li></ul><p>I would like to learn more about machine learning, artificial intelligence,
internet-of-things/hardware, VR, and aerospace-anything.</p><p>I enjoy working on JavaScript tooling, React.js, Webpack, and their kin. I
suspect I‚Äôd enjoy the analogous tools for other languages and platforms if I
knew anything.</p><p>I find hardware and the IoT space fascinating. I am more excited in seeing
others create things with <a href=http://iamdustan.com/react-hardware>React Hardware</a>
than I am about building my own <a href=https://twitter.com/ken_wheeler/status/822840186136621056>remote-controlled crossbows</a>.</p><p>I think machine learning and AI is the future. Granted, I am <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pkyy57iMaB0">Jon Snow</a>
in this world, but I wouldn‚Äôt mind that changing.</p><p>Companies exploring space, deploying satellites, mining asteroids, landing
rockets on boats, or anything else from the future are high on the list.
Granted, all I do are JavaScript toys. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Know anyone with the space
(haha) for someone like me?</p><p>I love/hate writing, teaching, and speaking.</p><p>I have a few conversations right now that I am excited about. I feel so blessed
to be having conversations with people who have the vision to change the way
interaction designers create and to democratize the UI development process.
I‚Äôm lucky to talk to people who are (more-or-less) building Minority Report and
to companies who enable engineers to deploy software and hardware with a
<code>git push</code> (there is more than one üòâ).</p><p>Whatever is next, I want to make a positive change in the world. Our mission is
greater than our tech stack.</p><p>(Of course React will still be in that tech stack.)</p></div></article><footer class=py:24><div class="f:fade-30 f:14 mb:8"></div><div class="f:fade-60 f:12">Theme <a class=f:bold href=https://github.com/serkodev/holy _target=_blank>Holy</a></div></footer></div></div></body></html>
