So you’ve been programming for a while now and you want to explore what other
languages are there. How do you choose?

Do you choose based on how you think you might get a job?
Or do you choose where all the “excitement” is?

My advice? Find something that will *change the way you think about
programming*.

Most likely you’ve been writing in some form of object-oriented language. That’s
great. It’s what the vast majority of professional software developers author
in.

*Please*, don’t choose another OO language. Choose a language that has
fundamentally different ideas about programming. Or choose a language that aims
to solve an entirely different problem space. Choose a **functional language**.
Choose a **systems language**. Choose an obscure or esoteric language. Its
impact on you will be far greater.

For example, I’ve been a fronteer my entire professional career. This means my
primary programming language has been JavaScript. Despite it’s warts, I love
JavaScript. Likely for the same reason I love the English language. It’s the way
my brain models the world. Thus, I could choose a related language that I could
easily apply at work such as C# or Ruby. This will feel familiar in how I model
the world, and it’s relatively simple to adjust to. Learning the syntax and the
idioms of the community and I’m off to the races.

The trouble for me is I can’t understand how *I* become better. Ruby and C# are
too close to my mother tongue.

I choose to learn another language because I want to fundamentally change the
way I think about programming.

Functional programming is fundamentally different than object oriented. Systems
programming is fundamentally different than UI and web programming.

I’m going to learn a functional language. I might even learn a systems language.
You should join me.
