From\\nthat point, becoming <strong>Master Craftsman</strong> would involve investing the\\nrest of your life achieving, yet the return for such pursuits is nominal\\ncompared to what has already been achieved.</p>\\n<p>At the Berlin Academy of Music on violin players, Anders Ericsson did\\nin-depth research on time invested in practice and training and the\\nresulting skill level of their violinists. What they discovered was that to\\nbecome an average level violinist took around 4000 hours of practice.\\nAfter 8000 hours one would become a good violinist. Yet to become the\\nelite you would have to spend up to 10,000 hours to emerge.</p>\\n<p>Those time periods, in full-time work equal out to about 2 years, 4\\nyears, and 5 years.</p>\\n<h2>Where Do You Want to Go?</h2>\\n<p>To me this is wonderful news. 2011 was the best year ever for me. I\\nchanged employers three times in order to be amongst the best in class\\nwith <a href=\\\"http://skookum.com\\\">Skookum</a>. I have spent the past 16 months\\npushing myself into the “good” level of a front-end developer.</p>\\n<p>Not great. Not expert. But good. I can do a lot. A lot more than I ever\\nimagined I could.</p>\\n<p>And I love it.</p>\\n<p>My design skills are wretched. But that’s okay. I know that when the\\ntime comes, just a couple years of persistant, dedicated hard work and the\\nfruits of the labor will be rewarded. I think Ira Glass spoke to the\\nbeginning of the journey with great truth.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me.\\nAll of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good\\ntaste.</p>\\n<p>But there is this gap.</p>\\n<p>For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s\\ntrying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the\\nthing that got you into the game, is still killer.</p>\\n<p>And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people\\nnever get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do\\ninteresting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work\\ndoesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have.</p>\\n<p>We all go through this.</p>\\n<p>And if you are just starting out or you are still in this\\nphase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do\\nis do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you\\nwill finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that\\nyou will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your\\nambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone\\nI’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile.</p>\\n<p>You’ve just gotta fight your way through.”</p>\\n<p><cite>Ira Glass</cite></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The destination isn’t where you want to be. It’s the\\njourney.

I cannot recommend this book enough.</p>\\n<p>Having read the <em>Ender’s Game</em> quartet last year, I picked up the <em>Bean\\nQuartet</em> by Orson Scott Card this year. The first book is the exact same\\nstory as <em>Ender’s Game</em>, but through Bean’s eyes. The\\nfollowing three books are a much faster paced adventure through an earth\\nin a not-to-distant future.</p>\\n<p><em>Love Wins</em> by Rob Bell is a book that received much attention when it\\ncame out—and not positive attention… I must say that as a\\nChristian it greatly challenged my view of God and His love. If nothing\\nelse, it shows God’s love in such a greater light than what I had\\never imagined.</p>\\n<p>I can’t remember a single technical book I’ve read before\\nthis year that I would strongly recommend. These year there were four.</p>\\n<p>David Herman and Reg Braithwaite have written the two best books on\\nJavaScript. Effective JavaScript and JavaScript Allongé. If you spend\\nany time at all in JavaScript at a professional level you should read\\nthese books.</p>\\n<p>Effective JavaScript is a very thorough, dispassionate\\nexplanation of the JavaScript language.

ClojureScript. For JavaScript Developers\",\"tags\":[\"clojurescript\"],\"summary\":null,\"body\":\"<p>I’ve wanted to add a functional language to my knowledge belt for quite some\\ntime now. If you check out my <a href=\\\"/2014/01/09/reading-list/\\\">2013 reading list</a> you\\nmay have noticed a Haskell book in there. Haskell was my introduction to thinking\\nwithout state, but rather with immutable data structures and the syntax was so\\nentirely different from what I was used to with JavaScript that I could not\\nmerely port my knowledge for how to solve a problem over in most situations.</p>\\n<p>Haskell didn’t have much practical benefit to me, either. After getting through\\nthe book there was nothing pushing me onward.</p>\\n<p>I’ve recently begun my second attempt into the functional world, this time with\\nClojureScript. I intend on writing about this journey over the next few months,\\nso let’s get started.</p>\\n<h2>Why a functional language?</h2>\\n<p>It took only a tiny introduction to the functional world to realize how\\ndifferent solving problems could be. My slight foray into Haskell already\\nchanged how I think about building applications and organizing code. I figure I\\ncould get more bang for the educational buck by learning a fundamentally\\ndifferent way of solving problems with a functional language compared to picking\\nup another OOP language.</p>\\n<h2>Why ClojureScript?</h2>\\n<p>There are two closely related, yet distinct points to this that I think are\\nworth mentioning.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Why Clojure/ClojureScript over F#, Scheme, Haskell, OCaml, Erlang,\\n<a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Functional_languages\\\">et cetera</a>?</li>\\n<li>Why do I think I’ll stick through to competency with the language?</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h3>Why Clojure?</h3>\\n<p>There are some circumstantial reasons that have led to Clojure being on my\\nradar.</p>\\n<p>I’ve used many of the leading JavaScript frameworks in production, most recently\\nReact. React is the first tool I’ve used that didn’t leave a bad taste in my\\nmouth when I was finished. In fact, I’ve rather enjoyed every moment of it and\\ncouldn’t imagine building a browser-based application without it.</p>\\n<p>One of the books that I started reading this year was the <a href=\\\"http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html\\\">Structure and\\nInterpretation of Computer\\nPrograms</a>. I have only\\nread the first three sections of the first chapter, but that gave me enough lisp\\nknowledge to understand the basic semantics of languages that follow the lisp\\nstructure.</p>\\n<p>During this time, <a href=\\\"http://swannodette.github.io/\\\">David Nolen</a> started appearing\\nagain and again in my feed and was talking about all this ClojureScript,\\nimmutable data, core.async stuff. (Aside: it may be worth adding that I\\nfundamentally believe that the default “complex JavaScript codebase decoupling\\nthrough arbitrary events” pattern to be a poor choice, and that my time in the\\nAngular world was on a team that found the best way to pass data around to just\\narbitrarily mutate the nearest object.)</p>\\n<p>Since my experience and relevancy is rooted entirely in building user interfaces\\nin the browser world, tools and approaches that I can relate to my problem set\\nwin over other concepts, such as the “proof”-iness that Haskell provides.</p>\\n<h3>Why will I stick with it?</h3>\\n<p>This is the sticking point. I am a very driven, self-motivated individual, but\\nam terrible at focusing on any one thing for long enough to complete it.

Literally. If you\\nalready have experience building UIs, you can be productive and confident with\\nwhat you are writing with React in a mere 4 hours.</p>\\n<p>React’s approach fundamentally joins two disparate joints of the same limb\\ntogether.

Welcome (to the land of dragons)! Just kidding, it’s not that bad—just undocumented and not officially supported. ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯</p>\\n<p>This article is intended to be a high level view of the developer experience a renderer should aim to provide based on my experience with React, writing a renderer, and exploring other custom renderers. Note that this is <em>not</em> a guide on how to write a renderer.</p>\\n<p>tldr;</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>React devs are Web devs. Design your APIs accordingly.</li>\\n<li>Hide imperative APIs behind declarative ones. This is what makes React, React.</li>\\n<li>Progressive disclosure. Use invariants and warnings to educate consumers <em>while they use it</em>.\\nInterop with existing tools such as live reload, React DevTools, and module bundlers.</li>\\n<li>Bonus: Share your creations and learnings.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>React Developers are Web Developers</h2>\\n<p>The majority of React Developers are Web Developers first. At the very least the React community is rooted in the web platform. A renderer should implement web-centric APIs on top of the target platform where it makes sense.</p>\\n<p>For example, you should strongly consider providing CSS Layout for positioning and styling.</p>\\n<p>If there are form-style input controls they should follow DOM and React controlled vs uncontrolled semantics. Standard form controls such as tab focus, return key, and other expected navigation controls should “just work”.</p>\\n<p>“Learn once, write anywhere” should be your guiding principle when considering the public API of your renderer.</p>\\n<h2>Hide imperative APIs behind declarative ones</h2>\\n<p>The public API of components is far more important than the specifics of their implementation. It is the Renderer’s responsibility to take the weight of the platform and simplify it. React does this repeatedly. It takes a stateful world like the DOM and presents you an interface that allows you to simply describe what the DOM should be.</p>\\n<p>The platform APIs should be accessible as an escape hatch when required. As an example, in the browser environment we escape out of the declarative React authoring model to imperatively manage focus.</p>\\n<p>As a guideline, a sure sign that there is a better abstraction for you to provide is that your renderer requires the consumer to write lifecycle methods to interact with the target environment to accomplish simple, declarative tasks.</p>\\n<h2>Progressive Disclosure and Education</h2>\\n<p>Help the developer along. Use warnings and invariants to provide educational messages as to why they are receiving that message and what can be done to rectify it.</p>\\n<p>React does this when attempting to render a <tr /> directly into a <table />. React Hardware is taking the pin today from the board and verifying that an acceptable mode is being used.</p>\\n<p>On React Native you are likely familiar with the Red and Yellowboxes (in your face variations on the former examples) which are incredibly helpful to use the project without having to query documentation endlessly.</p>\\n<p>Development integration always trumps walls of documentation. Provide the knowledge needed when it is needed.</p>\\n<h2>Interop with existing tools</h2>\\n<p>The React ecosystem has flourished a bevy of tools. A handful of this could be considered core or foundational. It should be your aim to interop with these.</p>\\n<p>Hot reloading has been transformative to many UIEs on the web and now with React Native, too. The React team supports Flow type definitions for static analysis regarding program correctness, safety, and documentation. The official React DevTools are a nice addition (not to mention the benefits of running and debugging code in a browser context). Lastly common module bundlers such as Webpack, Browserify, and Rollup should also be able to consume and build for your platform (if a simple <code>node index.js</code> does not suffice).</p>\\n<h2>Share</h2>\\n<p>As with anything in our software community, sharing is an enabler. React’s public API is quite stable and predictable, but the internals are not quite so clear. The use cases and patterns you need to implement your renderer will be extremely useful to the React team as they move towards having a better story for custom renderers. Additional parts of the API are also still being thought up and iterated upon such as a DevTools API.</p>\\n<p>Be a giant.

Alas, it\\ntook much trial and error and help from others and reading of code to see what\\nreality.</p>\\n<h2>Integration Points</h2>\\n<p>Once again, <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/matthewwithanm\\\">@matthewwithanm</a> showed me that\\nNuclide has first-class support for React Native.</p>\\n<figure>\\n  <img src=\\\"react-native-nuclide.gif\\\">\\n  <figcaption>React Native and React DevTools in Nuclide</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/alex_frantic\\\">@alex_frantic</a> mentioned that it should <em>just\\nwork</em> for any other renderer. I had the DevTools and React Hardware definitely\\nconnecting in some capacity, but nothing was working.</p>\\n<p>I spent a couple nights adding logs to <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/700658352850743296\\\">React core</a>,\\nthe DevTools codebase, and React Hardware to get a sense for what was happening\\nand where what was running.</p>\\n<p>Eventually I found the following files:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>ReactNative’s <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/9a93a3cba47722a590a8912a5ace1c479eb4178a/Libraries/Devtools/setupDevtools.js\\\"><code>setupDevTools.js</code></a></li>\\n<li>ReactDevtools’ <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools/blob/master/backend/attachRenderer.js\\\"><code>attachRenderer.js</code></a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>For completeness, ReactDOM 0.15’s implementation is located in the source <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/dom/ReactDOM.js#L45-L69\\\">ReactDOM.js</a></p>\\n<h3>Duck punch monkey patch</h3>\\n<p>React DevTools are doing what I like to call the <em>duck punch monkey patch</em>. For\\nall the gory details take a read through the files in <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools/tree/master/backend/integration\\\">react-devtools/backend/integration</a>.\\nIn there you will find test cases against each official renderer.</p>\\n<p>To work with React Devtools <em>today</em> you need to ensure your <em>RendererMount</em>\\ninterface looks like React Native, React 0.14, or React 0.15. There are a few\\nkey points:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>Mount.renderComponent/_renderNewRootComponent</code> must return a ReactComponent</li>\\n<li><code>Mount.renderComponent</code> must set <code>_instancesByReactRootID</code> correctly. Keep in\\nmind you’ll likely want to clean up this object to prevent memory leaks.</li>\\n<li><code>Mount._instancesByReactRootID</code> must exist for the devtools (I <em>think</em> you\\nhave an option between that interface or what React Native uses.)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>In addition, you will likely be writing your own <em>CustomRendererComponent</em>.\\nThere is one property (that I’m currently aware of) this must hold as well:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>mountComponent</code>: must return an identifier or lookup string. React Native\\nreturns an identifier hash of sorts whilst ReactDOM returns the markup string.\\nIn React Hardware I’m simply <a href=\\\"https://github.com/iamdustan/react-hardware/blob/rewrite/src/ReactHardwareComponent.js#L187\\\">returning the RootID</a>\\nwhich is working so far.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2><code>window.__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__</code></h2>\\n<p>Remember the <code>setupDevtools.js</code> file from earlier? That file is responsible for\\nsetting up a websocket to the DevTools backend. When initialized, the DevTools\\nbackend sends over a JavaScript program that <code>setupDevtools.js</code> evals.</p>\\n<p>As long as you have aliased your environments global object to <code>window</code> the\\nDevTools program can define the <code>__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__</code> for a renderer\\nto inject into.</p>\\n<p>React Hardware runs in node, so we simply alias <code>GLOBAL</code> to <code>window</code>, start a\\nwebsocket server for the DevTools to connect to, and step one is complete. At\\nthis point the DevTools and the renderer are communicating.</p>\\n<p>The next step is a bit trickier to debug and verify. Here you need to ensure\\nthat your renderer is able to get duck-punched-monkey-patched. Since this is not\\na first class API you won’t be in for a great time. No debugging, error, or\\nwarning messages will be printed for you. Good luck! ;)</p>\\n<h2>DevTools today and the future</h2>\\n<p>The DevTools monkey patching wraps a few renderer methods to emit a handful of\\nevents:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>root</code></li>\\n<li><code>mount</code></li>\\n<li><code>update</code></li>\\n<li><code>unmount</code></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>I believe that this is to provide enough information to reconstruct the Render\\ntree.</p>\\n<p>In the future these integration points will become clearer. This is\\nunquestionably a good thing, but will also likely bring a bit of pain for any\\nwho join the custom renderer club.

This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.\n *\n *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks.

You can see the five minute lightning talk he gave at\\nIgniteCharlotte on <a href=\\\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEoDiykT0MA\\\">YouTube</a>\\nand follow along with the slides at\\n<a href=\\\"https://speakerdeck.com/bermonpainter/jack-of-all-trades-master-of-many\\\">SpeakerDeck</a>.</p>\\n<p>The argument Bermon puts forth is that within a years time, you can\\nbe a good craftsman at anything. By applying yourself fully for a year,\\nyou will have gained sufficient mastery to serve most purposes. From\\nthat point, becoming <strong>Master Craftsman</strong> would involve investing the\\nrest of your life achieving, yet the return for such pursuits is nominal\\ncompared to what has already been achieved.</p>\\n<p>At the Berlin Academy of Music on violin players, Anders Ericsson did\\nin-depth research on time invested in practice and training and the\\nresulting skill level of their violinists. What they discovered was that to\\nbecome an average level violinist took around 4000 hours of practice.\\nAfter 8000 hours one would become a good violinist. Yet to become the\\nelite you would have to spend up to 10,000 hours to emerge.</p>\\n<p>Those time periods, in full-time work equal out to about 2 years, 4\\nyears, and 5 years.</p>\\n<h2>Where Do You Want to Go?</h2>\\n<p>To me this is wonderful news. 2011 was the best year ever for me. I\\nchanged employers three times in order to be amongst the best in class\\nwith <a href=\\\"http://skookum.com\\\">Skookum</a>. I have spent the past 16 months\\npushing myself into the “good” level of a front-end developer.</p>\\n<p>Not great. Not expert. But good. I can do a lot. A lot more than I ever\\nimagined I could.</p>\\n<p>And I love it.</p>\\n<p>My design skills are wretched. But that’s okay. I know that when the\\ntime comes, just a couple years of persistant, dedicated hard work and the\\nfruits of the labor will be rewarded. I think Ira Glass spoke to the\\nbeginning of the journey with great truth.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me.\\nAll of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good\\ntaste.</p>\\n<p>But there is this gap.</p>\\n<p>For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s\\ntrying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the\\nthing that got you into the game, is still killer.</p>\\n<p>And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people\\nnever get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do\\ninteresting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work\\ndoesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have.</p>\\n<p>We all go through this.</p>\\n<p>And if you are just starting out or you are still in this\\nphase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do\\nis do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you\\nwill finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that\\nyou will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your\\nambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone\\nI’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile.

He discusses how our mind works as two\\ndifferent systems in an engaging way that allows for understanding to\\ncome as you read through. I cannot recommend this book enough.</p>\\n<p>Having read the <em>Ender’s Game</em> quartet last year, I picked up the <em>Bean\\nQuartet</em> by Orson Scott Card this year. The first book is the exact same\\nstory as <em>Ender’s Game</em>, but through Bean’s eyes. The\\nfollowing three books are a much faster paced adventure through an earth\\nin a not-to-distant future.</p>\\n<p><em>Love Wins</em> by Rob Bell is a book that received much attention when it\\ncame out—and not positive attention… I must say that as a\\nChristian it greatly challenged my view of God and His love. If nothing\\nelse, it shows God’s love in such a greater light than what I had\\never imagined.</p>\\n<p>I can’t remember a single technical book I’ve read before\\nthis year that I would strongly recommend. These year there were four.</p>\\n<p>David Herman and Reg Braithwaite have written the two best books on\\nJavaScript. Effective JavaScript and JavaScript Allongé. If you spend\\nany time at all in JavaScript at a professional level you should read\\nthese books.</p>\\n<p>Effective JavaScript is a very thorough, dispassionate\\nexplanation of the JavaScript language.

For JavaScript Developers\",\"tags\":[\"clojurescript\"],\"summary\":null,\"body\":\"<p>I’ve wanted to add a functional language to my knowledge belt for quite some\\ntime now. If you check out my <a href=\\\"/2014/01/09/reading-list/\\\">2013 reading list</a> you\\nmay have noticed a Haskell book in there. Haskell was my introduction to thinking\\nwithout state, but rather with immutable data structures and the syntax was so\\nentirely different from what I was used to with JavaScript that I could not\\nmerely port my knowledge for how to solve a problem over in most situations.</p>\\n<p>Haskell didn’t have much practical benefit to me, either. After getting through\\nthe book there was nothing pushing me onward.</p>\\n<p>I’ve recently begun my second attempt into the functional world, this time with\\nClojureScript. I intend on writing about this journey over the next few months,\\nso let’s get started.</p>\\n<h2>Why a functional language?</h2>\\n<p>It took only a tiny introduction to the functional world to realize how\\ndifferent solving problems could be. My slight foray into Haskell already\\nchanged how I think about building applications and organizing code. I figure I\\ncould get more bang for the educational buck by learning a fundamentally\\ndifferent way of solving problems with a functional language compared to picking\\nup another OOP language.</p>\\n<h2>Why ClojureScript?</h2>\\n<p>There are two closely related, yet distinct points to this that I think are\\nworth mentioning.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Why Clojure/ClojureScript over F#, Scheme, Haskell, OCaml, Erlang,\\n<a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Functional_languages\\\">et cetera</a>?</li>\\n<li>Why do I think I’ll stick through to competency with the language?</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h3>Why Clojure?</h3>\\n<p>There are some circumstantial reasons that have led to Clojure being on my\\nradar.</p>\\n<p>I’ve used many of the leading JavaScript frameworks in production, most recently\\nReact. React is the first tool I’ve used that didn’t leave a bad taste in my\\nmouth when I was finished. In fact, I’ve rather enjoyed every moment of it and\\ncouldn’t imagine building a browser-based application without it.</p>\\n<p>One of the books that I started reading this year was the <a href=\\\"http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html\\\">Structure and\\nInterpretation of Computer\\nPrograms</a>. I have only\\nread the first three sections of the first chapter, but that gave me enough lisp\\nknowledge to understand the basic semantics of languages that follow the lisp\\nstructure.</p>\\n<p>During this time, <a href=\\\"http://swannodette.github.io/\\\">David Nolen</a> started appearing\\nagain and again in my feed and was talking about all this ClojureScript,\\nimmutable data, core.async stuff. (Aside: it may be worth adding that I\\nfundamentally believe that the default “complex JavaScript codebase decoupling\\nthrough arbitrary events” pattern to be a poor choice, and that my time in the\\nAngular world was on a team that found the best way to pass data around to just\\narbitrarily mutate the nearest object.)</p>\\n<p>Since my experience and relevancy is rooted entirely in building user interfaces\\nin the browser world, tools and approaches that I can relate to my problem set\\nwin over other concepts, such as the “proof”-iness that Haskell provides.</p>\\n<h3>Why will I stick with it?</h3>\\n<p>This is the sticking point. I am a very driven, self-motivated individual, but\\nam terrible at focusing on any one thing for long enough to complete it. I am\\nregularly spinning up new experiments and rewriting side projects long before\\ngetting them out the door.</p>\\n<p>Because ClojureScript can help solve problems I have building user interfaces is\\na huge plus to sticking this through. Honestly, that’s probably the primary\\nreason that I will continue with it for any length of time.</p>\\n<p>Everything else will be myself experimenting on myself. Setting myself a\\ncommitment to write about my journey I hope is enough perceived social pressure\\nto keep going.</p>\\n<h2>What to expect next?</h2>\\n<p>My current expectation is that the next two posts in the <a href=\\\"/tags/clojurescript/\\\">Learning ClojureScript\\nfor JavaScripters</a> series will be a “just enough” syntactic\\noverview, and then how to solve some common JavaScript problems in ClojureScript.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2014-09-02-clojurescript-for-javascript-developers-an-introduction/index.md\n ** module id = 443\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"layout\":\"post\",\"title\":\"Books of 2014\",\"tags\":[\"reading list\"],\"summary\":null,\"body\":\"<p>2014 was my year off from reading.

What lunacy is\\nthis?!?!</strong></p>\\n<p>Let’s take a step back and give the engineers who built this the benefit of the\\ndoubt for a moment. These are, inarguably, extremely intelligent individuals\\nworking on projects at scale, both in terms of developers touching the codebase\\nand product size. Not only that, they’re eating their dogfood by using this in\\nproduction. (For the uninitiated, React was originally created by the engineers\\nat Facebook and Instagram where they use it to power their web products.)</p>\\n<p>Knee-jerk reactions are expected, but let’s move beyond that for a moment.\\nTo echo the sentiments of other folks: <strong>give React half a day</strong>. Literally. If you\\nalready have experience building UIs, you can be productive and confident with\\nwhat you are writing with React in a mere 4 hours.</p>\\n<p>React’s approach fundamentally joins two disparate joints of the same limb\\ntogether. Yes, your structure and behavior are no longer spread across\\ntechnologies or files. With React components these two parts of the same thing\\ntravel together and <em>cannot</em> be separated.</p>\\n<h2>A short example</h2>\\n<p>Let’s say we want the expressive power of an iOS or Android style <code>Switch</code>\\ncomponent.  Transferring this concept to the web in a <code>form</code>-based way, I would\\nchoose to create some HTML around a <code>checkbox</code> input to accomplish this because\\nthe interface I would expect for a <code>switch</code> is identical to that of a <code>switch</code>.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>onChange</code> event handlers</li>\\n<li><code>checked</code> state (only slightly different semantics from <code>on|off</code>)</li>\\n<li><code>name</code></li>\\n<li><code>id</code></li>\\n<li><code>label</code></li>\\n<li>et cetera</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>First, let’s take a quick look at what consuming this component looks like. What\\nI would would want as the application developer would look something like this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-html\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">form</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">action</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"/api/endpoint\\\"</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">method</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"POST\\\"</span>&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">Switch</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">label</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Send robots to hug Dustan?\\\"</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">checked</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{true}</span> /&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">button</span>&gt;</span>Submit<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">button</span>&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">form</span>&gt;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Very clear and very expressive, no?

Welcome (to the land of dragons)! Just kidding, it’s not that bad—just undocumented and not officially supported. ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯</p>\\n<p>This article is intended to be a high level view of the developer experience a renderer should aim to provide based on my experience with React, writing a renderer, and exploring other custom renderers. Note that this is <em>not</em> a guide on how to write a renderer.</p>\\n<p>tldr;</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>React devs are Web devs. Design your APIs accordingly.</li>\\n<li>Hide imperative APIs behind declarative ones. This is what makes React, React.</li>\\n<li>Progressive disclosure. Use invariants and warnings to educate consumers <em>while they use it</em>.\\nInterop with existing tools such as live reload, React DevTools, and module bundlers.</li>\\n<li>Bonus: Share your creations and learnings.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>React Developers are Web Developers</h2>\\n<p>The majority of React Developers are Web Developers first. At the very least the React community is rooted in the web platform. A renderer should implement web-centric APIs on top of the target platform where it makes sense.</p>\\n<p>For example, you should strongly consider providing CSS Layout for positioning and styling.</p>\\n<p>If there are form-style input controls they should follow DOM and React controlled vs uncontrolled semantics. Standard form controls such as tab focus, return key, and other expected navigation controls should “just work”.</p>\\n<p>“Learn once, write anywhere” should be your guiding principle when considering the public API of your renderer.</p>\\n<h2>Hide imperative APIs behind declarative ones</h2>\\n<p>The public API of components is far more important than the specifics of their implementation. It is the Renderer’s responsibility to take the weight of the platform and simplify it. React does this repeatedly. It takes a stateful world like the DOM and presents you an interface that allows you to simply describe what the DOM should be.</p>\\n<p>The platform APIs should be accessible as an escape hatch when required. As an example, in the browser environment we escape out of the declarative React authoring model to imperatively manage focus.</p>\\n<p>As a guideline, a sure sign that there is a better abstraction for you to provide is that your renderer requires the consumer to write lifecycle methods to interact with the target environment to accomplish simple, declarative tasks.</p>\\n<h2>Progressive Disclosure and Education</h2>\\n<p>Help the developer along. Use warnings and invariants to provide educational messages as to why they are receiving that message and what can be done to rectify it.</p>\\n<p>React does this when attempting to render a <tr /> directly into a <table />. React Hardware is taking the pin today from the board and verifying that an acceptable mode is being used.</p>\\n<p>On React Native you are likely familiar with the Red and Yellowboxes (in your face variations on the former examples) which are incredibly helpful to use the project without having to query documentation endlessly.</p>\\n<p>Development integration always trumps walls of documentation. Provide the knowledge needed when it is needed.</p>\\n<h2>Interop with existing tools</h2>\\n<p>The React ecosystem has flourished a bevy of tools. A handful of this could be considered core or foundational. It should be your aim to interop with these.</p>\\n<p>Hot reloading has been transformative to many UIEs on the web and now with React Native, too. The React team supports Flow type definitions for static analysis regarding program correctness, safety, and documentation. The official React DevTools are a nice addition (not to mention the benefits of running and debugging code in a browser context). Lastly common module bundlers such as Webpack, Browserify, and Rollup should also be able to consume and build for your platform (if a simple <code>node index.js</code> does not suffice).</p>\\n<h2>Share</h2>\\n<p>As with anything in our software community, sharing is an enabler. React’s public API is quite stable and predictable, but the internals are not quite so clear. The use cases and patterns you need to implement your renderer will be extremely useful to the React team as they move towards having a better story for custom renderers. Additional parts of the API are also still being thought up and iterated upon such as a DevTools API.</p>\\n<p>Be a giant.

For example, you\\nwould inject your <code>CustomMount</code> and <code>CustomRendererComponent</code> into this.</p>\\n<p>The fact that each official renderer injects some internals into the DevTools\\nand has a different internal <code>Mount</code> API should’ve been enough to inform my\\nbrain that the devtools may be looking at or modifying these objects. Alas, it\\ntook much trial and error and help from others and reading of code to see what\\nreality.</p>\\n<h2>Integration Points</h2>\\n<p>Once again, <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/matthewwithanm\\\">@matthewwithanm</a> showed me that\\nNuclide has first-class support for React Native.</p>\\n<figure>\\n  <img src=\\\"react-native-nuclide.gif\\\">\\n  <figcaption>React Native and React DevTools in Nuclide</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/alex_frantic\\\">@alex_frantic</a> mentioned that it should <em>just\\nwork</em> for any other renderer. I had the DevTools and React Hardware definitely\\nconnecting in some capacity, but nothing was working.</p>\\n<p>I spent a couple nights adding logs to <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/700658352850743296\\\">React core</a>,\\nthe DevTools codebase, and React Hardware to get a sense for what was happening\\nand where what was running.</p>\\n<p>Eventually I found the following files:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>ReactNative’s <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/9a93a3cba47722a590a8912a5ace1c479eb4178a/Libraries/Devtools/setupDevtools.js\\\"><code>setupDevTools.js</code></a></li>\\n<li>ReactDevtools’ <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools/blob/master/backend/attachRenderer.js\\\"><code>attachRenderer.js</code></a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>For completeness, ReactDOM 0.15’s implementation is located in the source <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/dom/ReactDOM.js#L45-L69\\\">ReactDOM.js</a></p>\\n<h3>Duck punch monkey patch</h3>\\n<p>React DevTools are doing what I like to call the <em>duck punch monkey patch</em>. For\\nall the gory details take a read through the files in <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools/tree/master/backend/integration\\\">react-devtools/backend/integration</a>.\\nIn there you will find test cases against each official renderer.</p>\\n<p>To work with React Devtools <em>today</em> you need to ensure your <em>RendererMount</em>\\ninterface looks like React Native, React 0.14, or React 0.15. There are a few\\nkey points:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>Mount.renderComponent/_renderNewRootComponent</code> must return a ReactComponent</li>\\n<li><code>Mount.renderComponent</code> must set <code>_instancesByReactRootID</code> correctly. Keep in\\nmind you’ll likely want to clean up this object to prevent memory leaks.</li>\\n<li><code>Mount._instancesByReactRootID</code> must exist for the devtools (I <em>think</em> you\\nhave an option between that interface or what React Native uses.)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>In addition, you will likely be writing your own <em>CustomRendererComponent</em>.\\nThere is one property (that I’m currently aware of) this must hold as well:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>mountComponent</code>: must return an identifier or lookup string. React Native\\nreturns an identifier hash of sorts whilst ReactDOM returns the markup string.\\nIn React Hardware I’m simply <a href=\\\"https://github.com/iamdustan/react-hardware/blob/rewrite/src/ReactHardwareComponent.js#L187\\\">returning the RootID</a>\\nwhich is working so far.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2><code>window.__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__</code></h2>\\n<p>Remember the <code>setupDevtools.js</code> file from earlier? That file is responsible for\\nsetting up a websocket to the DevTools backend. When initialized, the DevTools\\nbackend sends over a JavaScript program that <code>setupDevtools.js</code> evals.</p>\\n<p>As long as you have aliased your environments global object to <code>window</code> the\\nDevTools program can define the <code>__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__</code> for a renderer\\nto inject into.</p>\\n<p>React Hardware runs in node, so we simply alias <code>GLOBAL</code> to <code>window</code>, start a\\nwebsocket server for the DevTools to connect to, and step one is complete. At\\nthis point the DevTools and the renderer are communicating.</p>\\n<p>The next step is a bit trickier to debug and verify. Here you need to ensure\\nthat your renderer is able to get duck-punched-monkey-patched. Since this is not\\na first class API you won’t be in for a great time. No debugging, error, or\\nwarning messages will be printed for you. Good luck! ;)</p>\\n<h2>DevTools today and the future</h2>\\n<p>The DevTools monkey patching wraps a few renderer methods to emit a handful of\\nevents:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>root</code></li>\\n<li><code>mount</code></li>\\n<li><code>update</code></li>\\n<li><code>unmount</code></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>I believe that this is to provide enough information to reconstruct the Render\\ntree.</p>\\n<p>In the future these integration points will become clearer. This is\\nunquestionably a good thing, but will also likely bring a bit of pain for any\\nwho join the custom renderer club. The following issues in React core are\\ngreat to follow if you are interested in following along as these APIs become\\nfirst class.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Umbrella: New Devtools API: <a
