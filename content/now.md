## About Dustan Kasten

I am a software engineering manager by day, leading three teams at Webflow.
I still can’t escape (neo)vim, tinkering on side projects quite regularly.

In another life, I’d write a lot more music, but in the meantime I’m releasing
when I can. Listen to “If you were a tree” now on your favorite streaming services.

## About this website

I done’t write near as much as I would like, though I expect this to continue to be
a public location for random notes, thoughts, ideas, and projects I’m working on.

## Now?

About pages always felt overly sales-and-marketing, though I recently stumbled across
https://nownownow.com/about. This collection of pages is a snapshot into who I am and what I do.
