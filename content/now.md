## About this website

I haven’t published in a few years. Mostly because I last updated this site on a
pre-1.0 version of Gatsby that Kyle Matthews and I put together in 15 minutes
_during_ a React Conf session.

I expect this to continue to be a public location for random notes, thoughts,
and ideas. Those will likely be shallow entries across music, engineering
management, software engineering, visual development, neovim, and Obsidian.

## About Dustan Kasten

I am a software engineering manager by day, who still can’t escape vim. In
another life, I’d be a professional musician, but instead you can just walk by
my house to hear the sounds of why I most definitely am not.

## Now?

About pages always felt to sales-and-marketing for me, so recently I stumbled
across https://nownownow.com/about. This collection of pages is a snapshot into
who I am and what I do.
