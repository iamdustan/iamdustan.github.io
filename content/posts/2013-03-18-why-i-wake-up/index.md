## To help people.

Quite simple.

* I help companies streamline their company through business technology.
* I help companies improve their products through a better user experience.
* I help humans by assisting companies in scaling their technology product
to the point of creating new jobs.
* I help humans by educating my fellow web developers to do the same.

What I do matters. What you do matters, too.
