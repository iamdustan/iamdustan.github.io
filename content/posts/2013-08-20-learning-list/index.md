Just an arbitrary list of things I am currently in the process of
exploring and learning or want to someday.

* 3D Programming (WebGL)
* Linear Algebra
* Enough C++ to land a commit in any browser engine
* TypeScript or Dart
* How human&rsquo;s make decisions. Psychology/sociology.
* Game development
* Haskell
* Node.js
* Ruby (maybe Rails)
* Machine Learning
