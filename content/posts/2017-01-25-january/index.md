Yesterday, the 24th of January, was a rather shoddy day for many Directors at
Walmart Labs. They had to spend the day laying off a couple hundred of the most
productive, passionate, caring, and intelligent individuals I have had the
privilege to work with. Oh, me too.

I woke up today quite excited. I’m not certain what is next yet, but I know it
is going to be [awesome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StTqXEQ2l-Y). I am
excited and optimistic about the future. I’ll be sharing more about what drives
me over the next couple days.

For the moment I want to open my doors to you.

* if you were part of the chopping-of-heads—don’t hesitate to reach out.
* if you weren’t part of the chopping-of-heads—don’t hesitate to reach out.
* If you are hiring—don’t hesitate to reach out.
* If you want to talk about any challenges your team or organization is facing—don’t hesitate to reach out.

I’d be happy to hop on a call, chat, or email with you. If you’re in the
Charlotte, NC area let’s drink coffee ☕️ together! My desire is to help you in
any way I am able. Whether you need moral support, referrals, technical advice,
or React.js or JavaScript training I have some availability for *at least* the
next few weeks.

I am unbelievably proud of what my team has accomplished over the past 15
months. Watching each of them grow as team members, engineers, and individuals
has been profoundly rewarding. Building a great product throughout it all wasn’t
a bad means to the end. I am humbled and forever grateful to those who told me
they’d follow me anywhere. Thank you for making me a better person. Depending
upon where the next few weeks go I hope to provide you that opportunity.

In the words of [Ellen DeGeneres](https://twitter.com/TheEllenShow)—be kind to
one another.
