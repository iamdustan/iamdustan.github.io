Who knew funemployment could be so busy! I haven’t written much here or
contributed much to open source. I have done a pretty decent job on the other
goals from [my intentions](/2017/01/26/future/), though.

I’m fairly confident in who I *want* to work for next, so I decided to take
advantage of this time at taking a swing at starting a company. A couple friends
and I spent the past couple weeks working extremely hard at putting a coworking
space together.

We found a beautiful space in Cornelius, NC, received a preliminary commitment
to funding the buildout required, and started designing the space. Throughout
the course of our market research, though, we learned that we likely would not
be able to scale to the size necessary to cover the initial capital in an
appropriate timeframe.

There are other details I’d be happy to expound if you ever happen to get coffee
with me. All in all it was still an great learning experience. I co-filed for an
LLC for the first time ever. I looked at office space and discussed leasing
agreements. I calculated costs and revenue expectations across a number of
possible outcomes.

Now that that is off the table I suppose I’ll go back to preparing some
conference talks. See you at [ReactConf](http://conf.reactjs.com/) and
[React.London](https://react.london/)!
