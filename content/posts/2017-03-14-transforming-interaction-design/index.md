Today is the day that a new chapter has begun. I am joining the wickedly sharp
team at [Webflow](https://www.webflow.com) in the pursuit of transforming
interaction design and product development!

To explain why I am so excited about Webflow I want to share a short story. I
recently sat down with my friend [Rob Luke](https://twitter.com/RobLukeDesign)
to see what he’s working on at [Passport](https://passportinc.com/). I was
excited about what Passport is building and the caliber of what Rob was
creating, but what really struck me was the immense frustration I felt regarding
the process of product development.

Rob had these *beautiful* interactive screens that looked and felt like a native
application, except that they *were a total sham*. They weren‘t receiving data
from a live source. The design tools weren‘t generating code. They weren’t
outputting a product. They were creating `.gif`s!

**Why must the output of our design tools be so far divorced from the products our
customers use?**

**Why must we keep this barrier between creators and creation?**

I am perhaps too naive to be aware of technical answers to these questions. My
experience on the web indicate the reasoning is (at least partially) a cultural
issue. The altars we’ve built for ourselves are holding us back.

* “Semantic HTML”
* “CSS Architecture”.
* “Frameworks! Bundlers! Sass mixins!”

These are the gods to which we sacrifice progress. How blasphemous it is to not
hand-craft our markup languages like our 13th century clothing garments!

If we take a look to other design and content-driven industries we see that
there are other ways. The animation industry has tools to allow animators and
modelers to create rich, immersive stories without a developer recreating their
vision in hand-crafted, certifiably organic, 100% artisan code. Game development
tools such as [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) enable story-tellers, character
designers, and game developers to collaborate *together* in creating.

I want to see interaction design tools follow this path. We can enable creators
greater freedom of expression. We will empower designers not only to create, but
to publish to the world.

All this, of course, after I get through [ReactConf](http://conf.reactjs.com)
and [React.London](https://react.london). If you’ll be there too get in touch on
twitter [@iamdustan](https://www.twitter.com/iamdustan) and let’s chat!
