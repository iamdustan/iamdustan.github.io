Two days ago I have been off of Twitter for a year. Life has been really good
without it, but I also miss everyone in the React community whose ongoing
relationship was primarily based around communication on Twitter.

So I ask...do I come back? Or do I carry on with my life which has been really
beautiful without the world-always-burning-down ethos of Twitter.
