I’m posting this over a year late because I quit all forms of internet
interactions. I’m not committing, but I’m thinking about writing to formulate my
thoughts again so just pushing this up for posterity.

## The List

{{< books "2018" >}}

I find it interesting to review what I gravitate towards after the fact
to discover where my interests lie. Standout books for this year that I
have added to my recommended reading list are as follows:

<h2 class="visuallyhidden">Favorite Books of 2012</h2>

### The Ender&rsquo;s Game series by Orson Scott Card.

Orson Scott Card created in the Enderverse will stay with me for a long
time to come.</p>
