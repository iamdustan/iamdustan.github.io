I’m posting this over a year late because I quit all forms of internet
interactions. I’m not committing, but I’m thinking about writing to formulate my
thoughts again so just pushing this up for posterity.

to discover where my interests lie. Standout books for this year that I
have added to my recommended reading list are as follows:

Orson Scott Card created in the Enderverse will stay with me for a long
time to come.</p>
