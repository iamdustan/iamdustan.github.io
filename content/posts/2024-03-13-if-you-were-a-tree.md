Today is the day. My first music release has finally started hitting the streaming shelves.

These songs are not new songs, but for my music creating journey are important.

[**Seas**](https://open.spotify.com/track/1ihB49KoTc2xQvqpORPcMK?si=32d8cf76d86c40d4)
is the first song I wrote and I’ve continued to play it and enjoy it for the
past 6 years.

[**Self help**](https://open.spotify.com/track/4ljo42o2lBSS8LYgmsD6Io?si=a9954ae6914c46b7) is the most recently completed song.


Give them a stream and let me know if you’d like to hear more.
