2016 was not “the Year of the Book” for me. Instead I moved into a new house,
changed companies, and my wife and I had had our second child.

I also switched to Team Android, whilst my reading list was on my old iPhone,
hence the reading list post in May.

## Highlights

I would recommend Engage the Fox, The Worthing Saga, The (Honest) Truth About
Dishonesty, and The Music of the Primes for all audiences.

*Engage The Fox* is an enjoyable business and management book about team
building, trust, and empowering others told through a fable. This was just the
second book I’ve read in that style. The animals throughout the story are all
quite memorable. Although I don’t recall the precise model the book laid out to
tackle difficult business situations, I do recall many of the themes based on
the different characters’ traits.

I’ve always been an Orson Scott Card fan and have read *many* books out of the
Enderverse. *The Worthing Saga* is the first non-Enderverse story I’ve read of
his and dannng it is a great story. I regularly didn’t know whether I should
love or despise different characters and my emotions became much more conflicted
and nuanced just like in real life. It will open your eyes to see people in new
ways.

Dan Ariely’s book, *The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty*, is honestly
delightful. I’ve always been fascinated by how the brain works. Studies have
shown that we’re all a little bit dishonest and generally have a similar
capacity and desire for dishonesty. If you’ve ever been interested in how
yourself and others make decisions alone, in a group, or with strangers, this
book is for you.

Lastly, I ended the year with *The Music of the Primes*. For as long as I can
remember I’ve always had a certain fondness for the primes. Being in the
software industry I’ve been familiar with the practical application of prime
numbers for a suite of reasons. This book filled in more of the practical
applications of prime numbers with an enjoyable history of our human endeavor
into understanding the primes and what makes a mathematicians tick.

## 2016?

I work from home with two small children. I have less time for reading than I
ever did, though I do intend on reading more in 2016 than in 2015. I learned
conversational Clojure in 2015, so 2016 will be the year of Rust. Additionally,
I plan on expanding my knowledge outside of computers a bit more and pick up
some electronics and woodworking, so expect to see some books along these lines
at the next installation of my reading list.
