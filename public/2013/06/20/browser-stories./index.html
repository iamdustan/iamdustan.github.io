No, no. Neither of these were the core of my discomfort." />

<p>No, no. Neither of these were the core of my discomfort.</p>
<p>You see, I have been thinking about my purpose in doing what I do, what are
the qualities in the men and women I want to have close relationships
with. Then it struck me. The complete and utter difference of tone
amongst the browser vendors.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am primarily a Chrome user. This came about because I
started getting serious about web development shortly before Chrome came
out and I it’s developer tools blew Firebug out of the water. And
Google was telling a better story with Chrome.</p>
<h2 id="a-short-survey-on-the-purpose-of-browser-vendors">A short survey on the purpose of browser vendors.</h2>
<h3 id="mozilla">Mozilla</h3>
<p>To improve the web for humans through safety, personalization, and
security. To make the web ubiquitious. (Sure, their primary mission
has shifted slightly in recent years).</p>
<p>Purpose: the betterment of human lives.</p>
<h3 id="google">Google</h3>
<p>To push the web platform forward. To improve the lives of web developers
everywhere. To make the web ubiquitious.</p>
<p>Purpose: the betterment of human lives.</p>
<h3 id="apple">Apple</h3>
<p>In all things, be user-centered. Provide users with the best experience.</p>
<p>Purpose: the betterment of human lives.</p>
<h3 id="opera">Opera</h3>
<p>Push the web platform forward. Be a voice of change and reason in the
vendor community and a staple in the standards process.</p>
<p>Purpose: the betterment of human lives</p>
<h3 id="microsoft">Microsoft</h3>
<p>Be number one in the market.</p>
<p>Purpose: survive, thrive, and somehow hopefully even <em>win</em> against the
competition.</p>
<h2 id="the-contrast">The Contrast</h2>
<p>This is not a direct endorsement or dig against any of these companies
now any individuals within them. Each of these companies are filled with
noble individuals with noble intentions.</p>
<p>Stories are powerful. They shape our lives. The stories we tell are
impacting and changing the landscape around us.</p>
<p>In the many months since I first wrote this draft Microsoft has
been changing. The IE developer relations team behind modern.ie are
doing a far superior job changing the story that Microsoft is telling.</p>
