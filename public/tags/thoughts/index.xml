      <description>There has always been something about Microsoft’s copy that bothers me. From their marketing copy on the IE download page, to their IE developer blog. I never quite could quite tell why.
Was it the arrogant tone with pleaful text shouting, “Look! We’re faster than Chrome with these benchmarks we wrote!”?
Was it the constant digs at other browser vendors in the midst of an otherwise sensible post?
No, no. Neither of these were the core of my discomfort.</description>
