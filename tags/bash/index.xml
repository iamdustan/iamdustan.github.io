My workflow often involves running daggumnpm in a tmux session and working on something else while npm does it’s thing. When everything works this is great because I hear the friendly “Greetings, Dustan Kasten&amp;hellip;” message when the install completes. However, when npm install fails I completely forget about that process for entirely too long.
Whilst this could still be done with a single line bash alias, I’ve opted to use a more verbose implementation in the following little function reinstall.</description></item><item><title>daggumnpm: a friendly bash utility</title><link>http://iamdustan.com/2016/02/18/daggumnpm-a-friendly-bash-utility/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2016 09:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>http://iamdustan.com/2016/02/18/daggumnpm-a-friendly-bash-utility/</guid><description>Update: there is an updated version of this at /2016/05/11/reinstall-daggumnpm/
No matter what version of npm you use, you likely have had to destroy your node_modules folder and do a clean npm install to debug some issue. This likely isn’t exclusive to npm either, but any package manager. Regardless, here’s a quick friendly bash script to reinstall your node_modules fresh, let you know when it’s done, and automatically run the previous command.</description></item></channel></rss>
