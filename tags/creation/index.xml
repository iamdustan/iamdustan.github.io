Quite simple.
I help companies streamline their company through business technology. I help companies improve their products through a better user experience. I help humans by assisting companies in scaling their technology product to the point of creating new jobs. I help humans by educating my fellow web developers to do the same. What I do matters. What you do matters, too.</description></item><item><title>Forks and Journeys.</title><link>https://iamdustan.com/2013/02/17/forks-and-journeys./</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Feb 2013 09:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://iamdustan.com/2013/02/17/forks-and-journeys./</guid><description>Who and where you are today is the cumultive effect of a lifetime of decisions. Actions. Reactions. Five years ago if you would’ve asked me what I would be doing for a living one year hence I would’ve had no clear answer for you. Yet, fate had it that I would be beginning my journey into web development.
Fast forward three years and you will find me working at JR Motorsports doing web design and front-end development, albeit at a rather mediocre level.</description></item></channel></rss>
