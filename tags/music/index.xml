My first music release has finally started hitting the streaming shelves.
These songs are not new songs, but for my music creating journey are important.
Seas is the first song I wrote and I’ve continued to play it and enjoy it for the past 6 years.
Self help is the most recently completed song.
Give them a stream and let me know if you’d like to hear more.</description></item></channel></rss>
