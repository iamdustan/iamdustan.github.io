I’m not committing, but I’m thinking about writing to formulate my thoughts again so just pushing this up for posterity.

Life has been really good without it, but I also miss everyone in the React community whose ongoing relationship was primarily based around communication on Twitter.
So I ask&amp;hellip;do I come back? Or do I carry on with my life which has been really beautiful without the world-always-burning-down ethos of Twitter.</description></item><item><title>Books of 2016</title><link>http://iamdustan.com/2016/12/28/books-of-2016/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2016 09:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>http://iamdustan.com/2016/12/28/books-of-2016/</guid><description>Welp, it appears I have fallen off the reading list since having two kids. I did manage to sneak 12 books in yet this past year, but with a bit more fiction than years past. Apparently as I’ve entered 30 I appreciate entertainment just as much (or more than) learning. :)

Instead I moved into a new house, changed companies, and my wife and I had had our second child.
I also switched to Team Android, whilst my reading list was on my old iPhone, hence the reading list post in May.
The List Highlights I would recommend Engage the Fox, The Worthing Saga, The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty, and The Music of the Primes for all audiences.</description></item><item><title>Books of 2014</title><link>http://iamdustan.com/2015/01/23/books-of-2014/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2015 09:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>http://iamdustan.com/2015/01/23/books-of-2014/</guid><description>2014 was my year off from reading. Well, I read the Game of Thrones series. Now I sit here waiting for George R.R. Martin to finish the Winds of Winter so I can move on with my life for a month before waiting another 7 years for the 7th installation in the series. But alas, here is the list:
The List</description></item><item><title>Books of 2013</title><link>http://iamdustan.com/2014/01/09/books-of-2013/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2014 09:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>http://iamdustan.com/2014/01/09/books-of-2013/</guid><description>After accidentally reading 42 books in 2012, I had quietly set myself the goal of reaching 52 books in 2013. With a last minute book off of Lean Pub I pulled it off with 1 minute 12 seconds to spare.
The List Highlights There are a few stand out books from this list. First and foremost, Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman is a great book. I am fascinated by how the human mind works and this was my grand introduction to psychology.</description></item><item><title>Books of 2012</title><link>http://iamdustan.com/2013/01/16/books-of-2012/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jan 2013 09:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>http://iamdustan.com/2013/01/16/books-of-2012/</guid><description>In 2012, my voracious appetite for reading and learning had reached new heights. Without setting any direct goals for reading, I began the year consuming book upon book upon book and kept a running record of what I had read so at year’s end I could look back on it all and see what I had discovered.
I inadvertently almost averaged a book a week and ended the year with 42.</description></item></channel></rss>
